# ðŸ“§ Contact Form - Email Integration Guide

Your contact form is now ready! Currently, form submissions are logged to the console. Here are quick ways to integrate with email services:

## Option 1: EmailJS (Easiest - Client Side)
```bash
npm install emailjs-com
```
Then in your contact form component, replace the fetch call with EmailJS.

## Option 2: Nodemailer with SMTP (Server Side)
```bash
npm install nodemailer
```
Add to your `.env.local`:
```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
```

## Option 3: SendGrid API (Recommended)
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```
Add to your `.env.local`:
```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
```

## Option 4: Netlify Forms (If deploying to Netlify)
Just add `netlify` attribute to your form tag - no setup needed!
